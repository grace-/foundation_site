  <h1>Helping the OpenCV Library</h1>
  Whether you are an individual or a corporation, you can help the
  OpenCV library in many ways as detailed on the
  <a href="http://opencv.org/contribute.html">Contribute</a> page of the
  OpenCV library website.
  <h1>OpenCV Supporting Member</h1>
  <p>
    By becoming a <i>supporting member</i> of the OpenCV foundation, you
    help financially. Through your financial contribution, the OpenCV
    foundation supports:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>events meant to improve computer vision: workshops,
      brainstorm session, developer sessions</li>
    <li>prizes to promote research, code or computer vision
      activities</li>
    <li>infrastructure (e.g. web servers, build farms,
      administrative fees ...)</li>
    <li>development of the OpenCV library</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Any contribution can be made through the "DONATE" link on top of the
    <a href="http://opencv.org">OpenCV</a> website or by purchasing goodies on
    our <a href="http://fieldhouse.com/OpenCV">Store</a>.
  </p>

  <h1>Special Supporting Member</h1>

  <p>
    You can also become a <i>Member of OpenCV</i> by paying a yearly
    membership fee to the OpenCV foundation:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>$100 for individuals (that includes a personalized OpenCV
      gift)</li>
    <li>$1000 for corporations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You are then entitled to display the <i>Member of OpenCV</i> logo on
    your website or in printed materials. This membership also gives you
    the right to be heard at the board meetings but with no voting
    right. You could use that right to suggest any feature/direction for
    the foundation (e.g. if you want to sponsor an event or a feature in
    the OpenCV library)
  </p>
  <p>
    Corporations wishing to show exceptional participation to the OpenCV
    foundation can become a <i>Patron of OpenCV</i> by extending their
    membership fees:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>$5000 for small companies (less than 50 employees)</li>
    <li>$10000 for corporations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <i>Patrons of OpenCV</i> get the same features as the <i>Members
      of OpenCV</i> but also get a voting seat on the OpenCV foundation
    board of directors.
  </p>
  <p>
